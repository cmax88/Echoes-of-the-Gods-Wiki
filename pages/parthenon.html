        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Pantheon rests at the center of the Acropolis and is the site where mortals offer blessings and sacrifices in an attempt to please the Goddess, Athena.</p>
        <h3>Exterior</h3>

        <p>The stairway leads up to an alluring, patterned tile flooring, glimmering in the midday light. Cast completely of marble, The Parthenon shines with a godlike radiance, the white of the stone blessing the eyes of all who come to gaze upon it. To the left, an immaculate row of perfectly trimmed hedges run along the pathway and lead up to the Chamber of Athena&rsquo;s Tome. To the right, another row of hedges, this time leading the eyes to the magnificent stones of the Shrine of Nike. A beautifully painted rendition of Athena&rsquo;s birth can be seen carved into the roof of the entrance, illustrating the Gods of Olympia witnessing her being brought to this world from the crack of Zeus&rsquo;s head. The chiseled rows of columns tower into the skies and stand tall, watching over Athena and its residents. The doorway is decorated with an articulate bronze trim that runs the width of the frame. Rays of sunlight shine through the doorway, illuminating the interior of the temple.</p>
        <h3>Interior</h3>

        <br>
        <p>Stepping inside the Parthenon, you are encapsulated by the colossal statue of Athena on the far wall standing before you. She nearly reaches the roof of the inner sanctum, looking over those who enter. Her body is cast of the whitest marble with her clothes and her spear being forged of bronze. In her right hand sits Nike, Goddess of Victory. Along her left side, the owls Otus and Tyto stand obediently, ready to protect her from harm. A glance of the room reveals even more columns on either side of the room, rising up to the roof of the temple. A singular table sits in the center, with a large woven basket for sacrifice and incense candles for praying. A hand-stitched rug lies at the base of the statue, its art depicting Athena&rsquo;s heroic battle against Poseidon. Your footsteps echo across the vast empty hall as you make each step inward.</section>
