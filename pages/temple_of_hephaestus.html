        <p>As you approach the Temple of Hephaestus, you're immediately struck by its unique stature. Perched atop a jagged rock in the lower city, the temple seems to command attention and respect from all who behold it. The walls of the temple are made of rough-hewn stone, with imposing columns serving as supports at the entrance. The walls are adorned with intricate sculptures and bas-reliefs depicting the God of the Forge at work, creating weapons and armor for the gods. The entrance itself is a massive archway, guarded by two stone sentinels. These imposing figures seem to keep watch over all who approach the temple, their expressions stern and unyielding. The air around the temple is thick with the scent of smoke and metal, making it clear that this is a place of industry and toil. Despite this, there's an aura of reverence and holiness about the temple, inspiring a sense of awe and respect in all who visit it.</p>
        <h3>Interior</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="../media/templeofhephaestusinterior.png" alt="Temple of Hephaestus Interior" /></div>
        <br>
        <p>The door creaks as you push it open and step inside. The interior of the temple is a stark contrast to the rough exterior. You are surrounded by glittering marble walls and floor, the surfaces polished to a high shine. The walls are speckled with beautiful sculptures and tapestries, depicting the various feats and accomplishments of the God. In the center of the temple stands a towering statue of Hephaestus, his arms outstretched as if ready to strike. The statue is made of pure gold, and the attention to detail is incredible. You can see the muscles of his arms bulging, the sweat on his brow, and the look of intense focus on his face. Off to one side, there is a small alcove where offerings and gifts to the God can be placed. The shelves are filled with gold and silver coins, fine jewelry, and even the occasional weapon or piece of armor. The offerings are lit by flickering candles, casting dancing shadows over the treasures. The air is heavy with the smell of smoldering coals and molten metal. You can hear the distant sounds of hammers and tongs at work, even though there is no blacksmith to be seen. It is as if the spirit of Hephaestus himself is still at work within these walls. You pause, taking in the sights and sounds of this holy place. This temple is a testament to the power and skill of the God, and a reminder of his importance to the lives of the people of Athena.</section>
