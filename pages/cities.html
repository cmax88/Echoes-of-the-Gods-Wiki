<h3>Athena</h3>
            <div class="image-container"><img src="../media/athenacity.png" alt="City of Athena" /></div>
            <br>
<p>Athena is the major city in Gaia where wealthy and poor alike come from far lands on a pilgrimage to the sacred city. The Acropolis is the holiest of sites in all of Gaia, worshipping all the Olympian Gods. The Parthenon rests at the center of the Acropolis and is the site where mortals offer blessings and sacrifices in an attempt to please the Goddess Athena. In this city of worship, many temples are present here. First, the Temple of Hephaestus, located in Southwest Athena, is a temple for a God who is worshipped by few but revered by many. Hephaestus’ temple sits atop a rock outcropping, being the second tallest building in Athena, only behind that of the Parthenon. Second, the Temple of Agora, also located in Southwest Athena, praises the God, Hermes, God of Travel and Commerce. This site is visited primarily by the merchants and salesman of Gaia, who ask for the God’s guidance and protection in combat. The Temple of Plutus stands in Northwest Athena, a sit where the rich and wealthy go to praise Plutus, God of Wealth. Finally, the Temple of Zeus stands proudly in Eastern Athena. This temple, created by the God himself, represents the mortals’ ideals and mindsets of Gaia, and the deities that rule the known world. Next to its large temple structure stands a 60ft statue of Zeus, erected from bronze by order of the Gods.</p>
