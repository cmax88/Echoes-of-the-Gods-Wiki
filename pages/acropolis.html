        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Acropolis rests at the center of Athena, atop the tallest rock in the city. The Acropolis is the holiest of all sites in Gaia, worshipping all of the Olympian Gods. The Parthenon of the Acropolis is beautifully carved out of the stone that once stood atop the rock. The columns of the Parthenon consist of engravings depicting the epic 10-year battle between the Gods and the Titans. The Gods of Olympia can be seen in these carvings, each fighting a battle of their own. The God Hephaestus crafted the Acropolis on the island of Lemnos after being cast from Mount Olympus by Zeus, in an attempt to appease his father. Hephaestus soon became more and more upset with his father&rsquo;s actions, welding his creation to a rock with his tears and hurling it into the skies. Just as Hephaestus had, the Acropolis fell for 3 days, before landing perfectly in the center of the Goddess Athena&rsquo;s land. Upset with the new d&eacute;cor, Athena left the land to search for the culprit, never to return and later to be reclaimed by the mortals and the rock to be worshipped for the rest of time. Hephaestus is now praised in the Temple of Hephaestus for bringing forth the greatest gift to civilization ever known.</p>
