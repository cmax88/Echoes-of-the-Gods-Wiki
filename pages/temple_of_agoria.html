        <p>As you approach the temple, you are struck by its splendor. The temple is situated in the lower center of the bustling marketplace, surrounded by merchants selling their wares and customers haggling over prices. The temple is built of smooth, white marble, with columns that reach skywards. The front entrance is guarded by two massive bronze doors, engraved with images of Hermes, the messenger of the gods, in his various guises - as a trickster, a thief, and a protector of merchants and travelers. As you move closer, you can see that the columns are covered in intricate carvings of the god's adventures and exploits, depicted in vivid detail. Above the entrance, a statue of Hermes stands tall, his winged sandals and staff in hand, ready to take flight at a moment's notice. The temple exudes a sense of energy and excitement, a reflection of the vibrant marketplace that surrounds it. You can hear the sounds of laughter and bargaining, the clanging of metal on metal, and the songs of street performers, all contributing to the lively atmosphere of the temple.</p>

        <br>
        <p>As you step through the grand entrance, you are greeted by the bright and warm glow of candlelight. The walls are decorated with carvings depicting Hermes and his many adventures. The temple is filled with a sense of movement, as if the god himself is constantly in motion, watching over his followers. You walk down the main aisle, surrounded by rows of pews that lead up to the altar at the front of the temple. The altar is made of solid gold, with designs and symbols etched into its surface. On either side of the altar are two large statues of Hermes, his wings spread wide, his head turned towards the sky. As you continue down the aisle, you notice a large tapestry hanging on the wall to your right, depicting the myth of Hermes' birth. On the left, a group of priests are gathered, whispering prayers to the god. You feel a sense of peace and comfort as you take in the atmosphere of the temple. In the back of the temple, there is a small room filled with offerings and gifts left by followers, hoping for a blessing from the god. The room is quiet, with only the sound of the flickering candles and soft whispers of prayers echoing in the space.</section>
