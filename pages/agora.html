            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Agora is the Westernmost municipality of Athena and the grand market of the city. If you&rsquo;re not a scholar or a government official, this is where you&rsquo;ll make a good living. There are many different cultures and peoples represented here, all of which display a unique trade and a great sensibility. No one here is afraid to get into a tussle if they find the need and are hardy hagglers who are not easily persuaded. When Hermes, the God of Travel and Commerce, was trying to win over the heart of Athena, he would visit her day in and day out, giving Athena gifts to try and persuade her love. Although Athena had no interest in Hermes as a partner, she played into his game and allowed his gifts to pile up in the West of her land. Once she had left to return to Mount Olympus, the gifts were left behind. Of the gifts were many types of ships, horses, wagons, woods, metals, and stones. The mortals used these gifts to trade with other blossoming civilizations and quickly became an early center of commerce in Gaia. Hermes is now worshipped in his Temple of Agora, for giving the Athenians the gift of travel and commerce.</p>
