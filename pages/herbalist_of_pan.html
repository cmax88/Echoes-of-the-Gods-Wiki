        <p>As you approach, you are greeted by the sweet scent of herbs and flowers that waft from the small shop. The building is made of old, sturdy stones, and it stands two stories high. A sign that reads "Herbalist of Pan" hangs above the entrance, and ivy creeps up the walls, giving the building a natural and inviting feel. The windows are large and allow the warm sunlight to filter in, illuminating the shelves inside. The door is made of dark wood and has intricate carvings of herbs and plants on it, a nod to the shop's specialty. You step closer, eager to explore the treasures within this humble herb shop.
        <h3>Interior</h3>
        <br>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="../media/herbalistofpaninterior.png" alt="Herbalist of Pan Interior" /></div>
        <br>
        <p>As you step in, you are immediately surrounded by the sweet and earthy scent of herbs and flowers. The walls are lined with shelves, each one overflowing with a variety of dried and fresh herbs, roots, and spices. Sunlight streams in through the large, open windows, illuminating the rows of potted plants that fill the space. A wooden counter stands at the back of the shop, behind which a robed figure works tirelessly, grinding herbs into fine powders and mixing potions. The countertop is cluttered with jars of various sizes, each filled with a different ingredient, and there is a large mortar and pestle at one end. To your left, there is a small alcove filled with comfortable chairs and low tables, the perfect place for customers to relax and sample teas and remedies. To your right, there is a stairway leading to the upper level of the shop, where you can hear the rustling of papers and the soft murmur of someone at work.</section>
