            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Athena is the major city in Gaia where wealthy and poor alike come from far lands on a pilgrimage to the sacred city. The Acropolis is the holiest of sites in all of Gaia, worshipping all the Olympian Gods. The Parthenon rests at the center of the Acropolis and is the site where mortals offer blessings and sacrifices in an attempt to please the Goddess Athena. In this city of worship, many temples are present here. First, the Temple of Hephaestus, located in Southwest Athena, is a temple for a God who is worshipped by few but revered by many. Hephaestus&rsquo; temple sits atop a rock outcropping, being the second tallest building in Athena, only behind that of the Parthenon. Second, the Temple of Agora, also located in Southwest Athena, praises the God, Hermes, God of Travel and Commerce. This site is visited primarily by the merchants and salesman of Gaia, who ask for the God&rsquo;s guidance and protection in combat. The Temple of Plutus stands in Northwest Athena, a sit where the rich and wealthy go to praise Plutus, God of Wealth. Finally, the Temple of Zeus stands proudly in Eastern Athena. This temple, created by the God himself, represents the mortals&rsquo; ideals and mindsets of Gaia, and the deities that rule the known world. Next to its large temple structure stands a 60ft statue of Zeus, erected from bronze by order of the Gods.</p>

        <h3>Acropolis</h3>
        <p>The Acropolis rests at the center of Athena, atop the tallest rock in the city. The Acropolis is the holiest of all sites in Gaia, worshipping all of the Olympian Gods. The buildings of the Acropolis are beautifully carved out of the stone that once stood there. The columns of each building consist of engravings depicting the epic 10-year battle between the Gods and the Titans. The Gods of Olympia can be seen in these carvings, each fighting a battle of their own. The God Hephaestus crafted the Acropolis on the island of Lemnos after being cast from Mount Olympus by Zeus, in an attempt to appease his father. Hephaestus soon became more and more upset with his father&rsquo;s actions, welding his creation to a rock with his tears and hurling it into the skies. Just as Hephaestus had, the Acropolis fell for 3 days, before landing perfectly in the center of the Goddess Athena&rsquo;s land. Upset with the new d&eacute;cor, Athena left the land to search for the culprit, never to return and later to be reclaimed by the mortals and the rock to be worshipped for the rest of time. Hephaestus is now praised in the Temple of Hephaestus for bringing forth the greatest gift to civilization ever known.</p>
        <h3>Kiffisia</h3>
        <p>Kiffisia is the Northern municipality of Athena, populated by the wealthy and the privileged. It is speckled with marble and gold-plated buildings that shine with a radiant light that can be seen from many cities across Gaia. Scholars and government members reside in these homes and can often be found indulging in the local activities, whether it be studying in the Academy of Plato, or exercising at the Olypieum. These citizens control the water distribution in the city, oftentimes unfairly giving more to one section of the city than the other, just to watch chaos ensue. Plutus, God of Wealth, had an immense hatred for Athena. When he saw how upset she was with Hephaestus after his accidental stunt, he was inspired to pull a stunt of his own. Upon Athena&rsquo;s leave, Plutus snuck to her land and scattered a satchel of coins all across, covering the majority of the North with coinage. Once Athena returned, she became outraged at the sight and decided to return to Mount Olympus to the Hall of the Gods, vowing never to return to the mortal realm again. These coins were eventually reclaimed by Gaia in the years to come and erected into the buildings that now span across Kiffisia. Plutus is now worshipped in Kiffisia, at the Temple of Plutus, revered for the good fortune he gifted to the city of Athena.</p>
        <h3>Agora</h3>
        <p>Agora is the Westernmost municipality of Athena and the grand market of the city. If you&rsquo;re not a scholar or a government official, this is where you&rsquo;ll make a good living. There are many different cultures and peoples represented here, all of which display a unique trade and a great sensibility. No one here is afraid to get into a tussle if they find the need and are hardy hagglers who are not easily persuaded. When Hermes, the God of Travel and Commerce, was trying to win over the heart of Athena, he would visit her day in and day out, giving Athena gifts to try and persuade her love. Although Athena had no interest in Hermes as a partner, she played into his game and allowed his gifts to pile up in the West of her land. Once she had left to return to Mount Olympus, the gifts were left behind. Of the gifts were many types of ships, horses, wagons, woods, metals, and stones. The mortals used these gifts to trade with other blossoming civilizations and quickly became an early center of commerce in Gaia. Hermes is now worshipped in his Temple of Agora, for giving the Athenians the gift of travel and commerce.</p>
        <h3>Collytus</h3>
        <p>Collytus is the Eastern municipality of Athena and is known for both its arts and agriculture. The upper portion of Collytus is dedicated to the theatrics of the city, hosting both the Olypieum and the Flavian Amphitheatre, while the mid and lower areas are reserved for nature and agriculture. This municipality is mainly for the common people of Athena and it is where workers come to laid their heads at night. Zeus became wildly outraged with his daughter&rsquo;s leave from her lands and struck the Eastern lands down with a divine smite. From these smoldering grounds grew saintly fields that were always chalked full of crops. These fields feed all of Athena and bless the lands with their beauty. Zeus is now praised in his temple, the largest in the city, for his gift of life and prosperity to the mortals of Athena.</p>
        <h3>Gates</h3>
        <li><b>Diochares Gate:</b> The Northeastern gate of the city, leading to the city of Marathon.</li>
