            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Collytus is the Eastern municipality of Athena and is known for both its arts and agriculture. The upper portion of Collytus is dedicated to the theatrics of the city, hosting both the Olypieum and the Flavian Amphitheatre, while the mid and lower areas are reserved for nature and agriculture. This municipality is mainly for the common people of Athena and it is where workers come to laid their heads at night. Zeus became wildly outraged with his daughter&rsquo;s leave from her lands and struck the Eastern lands down with a divine smite. From these smoldering grounds grew saintly fields that were always chalked full of crops. These fields feed all of Athena and bless the lands with their beauty. Zeus is now praised in his temple, the largest in the city, for his gift of life and prosperity to the mortals of Athena.</p>
