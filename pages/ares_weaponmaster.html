        <p>As you approach the fortress, you are struck by the sheer size and strength of the structure. The walls are made of solid stone, standing tall and imposing against the sky. The entrance is a large, wooden gate that is guarded by two armored soldiers, their eyes scanning the area for any potential threats. To the right of the fort, you spot an archery range, where archers can be seen practicing their skills, arrows soaring through the air and hitting their targets with deadly accuracy. The sound of clanging metal and shouting can be heard from within the walls of the fort, indicating the bustling activity of the weapon makers within.</p>

        <br>
        <p>As you enter the fort, you are greeted by the smell of smoke and the sound of hammering. Everywhere you look, you see weapons and armor in various stages of creation, from glowing red in the forge to being honed and polished to perfection. The walls are lined with shelves, displaying a variety of weapons and armor for sale. The air is charged with the energy of creation, and you can feel the power of Ares presence here, as the God of War watches over his fort, ensuring that the strongest and most skilled warriors are equipped for battle. Further, into the fort, you find the forge, where the weaponsmiths work tirelessly to create the most deadly and durable weapons for the soldiers of Athena. The heat from the forge is intense, making the room feel almost unbearable, but the smiths work with precision and skill, expertly molding the metal into deadly blades and sturdy armor.</section>
