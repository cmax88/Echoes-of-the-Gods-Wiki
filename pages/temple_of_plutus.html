        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This temple sits by the Illithos River at the Western edge of the municipality. It is dedicated to the God Plutus, God of Wealth. It is the smallest temple in Athena but holds great value to the people of Kiffisia.</p>
        <h3>Exterior</h3>

        <br>
        <p>As you approach the Temple of Plutus, your eyes are immediately drawn to its towering structure. The building is made of gleaming white marble, and it is clear that no expense has been spared in its construction. The walls are adorned with intricate carvings of the God Plutus and his symbol, the golden satchel. You ascend a set of wide steps leading to the temple's entrance, and you are greeted by two massive stone columns supporting the pediment above. The columns are intricately carved with scenes depicting Plutus showering the people of the city with wealth and prosperity. The front of the temple is decorated with a statue of Plutus standing tall and proud, with a strong hand clutching a bag of gold coins. You see the temple's main entrance, a massive set of double doors carved from solid gold.</p>
        <h3>Interior</h3>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p>As you step inside, the first thing you notice is the sheer size of the interior. The walls of the temple are speckled with large paintings and frescoes, depicting Plutus and the blessings of wealth and prosperity. In the center of the room, a large statue of Plutus stands on a raised platform, surrounded by offerings and gifts from the faithful. The air inside the temple is thick with the scent of burning incense, and the sound of soft prayers can be heard echoing throughout the chamber. The walls are lined with smaller alcoves, each one dedicated to a different aspect of Plutus's power. You can see offerings and gifts laid at the feet of each statue, as supplicants seek Plutus's favor. As you move deeper into the temple, you come upon a room filled with glittering gold and precious gems. This is where the offerings are stored and where the priests of the temple can be found, counting and caring for the treasures of Plutus. The walls of this room are covered in gold leaf, and the floor is made of marble that sparkles in the light of the torches.</section>
