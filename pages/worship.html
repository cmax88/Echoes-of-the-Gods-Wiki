        <h3>The Basics</h3>
        <p>Through worship, a mortal can gain divine abilities in which will assist them throughout their journeys across Gaea. These traits need to be earned though, whether it be through a good deed or an unjust action. Worship is measured through Piety Points, the amount of which is decided by the DM for each divine action completed by a character. Every Piety Point goes toward the player&rsquo;s Piety Level, each major milestone being 3, 10, 25, and 50 Piety Points.</p>
