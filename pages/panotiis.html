        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Panotiis are a race of beings with large, floppy ears that cover their entire body. They are small and nimble creatures, standing at around three to four feet tall. Their large ears are their most distinctive feature, and they use them to sense their surroundings, communicate with each other, and even manipulate objects.</p>
        <p>The Panotiis are a playful and curious race, always eager to explore and discover new things. They are skilled musicians and dancers, using their large ears to create beautiful music and perform intricate dances. They are also quick and agile, making them excellent thieves and scouts.</p>
        <p>The Panotiis live in small, tight-knit communities, often in the hollows of trees or the nooks and crannies of the forest. They are social creatures, and they enjoy spending time with each other, playing games, and telling stories.</p>
        <p>In combat, the Panotiis are quick and elusive, using their large ears to dodge attacks and distract their enemies. They are not as physically strong as other races, but they are quick thinkers and are able to outmaneuver their opponents.</p>
        <p>Despite their small size and playful demeanor, the Panotiis are not to be underestimated. They are clever and cunning, and they are always looking for new adventures and challenges. They are a valued member of any adventuring party, using their quick wit and nimble skills to help their allies succeed.</p>
