            <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Kiffisia is the Northern municipality of Athena, populated by the wealthy and the privileged. It is speckled with marble and gold-plated buildings that shine with a radiant light that can be seen from many cities across Gaia. Scholars and government members reside in these homes and can often be found indulging in the local activities, whether it be studying in the Academy of Plato, or exercising at the Olypieum. These citizens control the water distribution in the city, oftentimes unfairly giving more to one section of the city than the other, just to watch chaos ensue. Plutus, God of Wealth, had an immense hatred for Athena. When he saw how upset she was with Hephaestus after his accidental stunt, he was inspired to pull a stunt of his own. Upon Athena&rsquo;s leave, Plutus snuck to her land and scattered a satchel of coins all across, covering the majority of the North with coinage. Once Athena returned, she became outraged at the sight and decided to return to Mount Olympus to the Hall of the Gods, vowing never to return to the mortal realm again. These coins were eventually reclaimed by Gaia in the years to come and erected into the buildings that now span across Kiffisia. Plutus is now worshipped in Kiffisia, at the Temple of Plutus, revered for the good fortune he gifted to the city of Athena.</p>
