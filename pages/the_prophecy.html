        <h3>Passage One:</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;Listen well, brave heroes of old, <br />A journey lies ahead, stories untold.<br />A world in peril, you must defend,<br />Against the Gods, your journey must bend.</p>
        <p>The first challenge you must overcome,<br />To the city of Thebes, you must become.<br />Where the daughters of Zeus wreck the lands,<br />And the fate of mortals&rsquo; rests in your hands.</p>
        <p>The Muses of nine hold the key,<br />To power and glory, for you and me.<br />Find them all, and destroy with might,<br />And the path to victory will come to sight."</p>
        <h3>Passage Two:</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;Oh, weary travelers, hear the words I say, <br />A task awaits you, on thine way. <br />A God of Illusion, Dolos, so bold, <br />His presence felt, in cities young and old.</p>
        <p>His power's growing, causing fear and strife, <br />As mortals suffer, with each and every life. <br />The world you know is but his play, <br />And so, you must, this power take away.</p>
        <p>Your journey leads, to the land of gold, <br />Where wealth and fame, are often told. <br />A city of merchants, where goods are sold, <br />But beware, for Dolos, has taken hold.</p>
        <p>In the market square, where merchants haggle and trade, <br />His illusions have taken, all they have made. <br />You must discover, the source of his power, <br />And with it, his hold, you must devour.</p>
        <p>Oh, brave adventurers, heed this call, <br />For victory, you shall stand tall. <br />With skill and might, you must succeed, <br />And the third passage, you shall indeed read.&rdquo;</p>
        <h3>Third Passage:</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;The third quest will lead to the fall, <br />Of light that shines, brighter than all. <br />With eyes of gold and a voice so sweet, <br />Apollo's power can't be beat.</p>
        <p>The force that shields the God of Light, <br />Is guarded well, with all its might. <br />But a clue's been given, in the dark of night, <br />That holds the key, to the end of the fight.</p>
        <p>A journey long, and a challenge great, <br />To defeat Apollo, will be your fate. <br />With courage strong and a heart so pure, <br />You must face the challenge that lies ahead, I'm sure.</p>
        <p>In Delphi, the city of Apollo's name, <br />You'll find his temple and the answer to the game. <br />With this trial finished, and with Apollo&rsquo;s defeat,<br />You'll be one step closer, to being complete.&rdquo;</p>
        <h3>Fourth Passage:</h3>
        <p>&ldquo;Listen well, brave adventurers, to what I say, <br />A quest to Korinthos, is where you must lay. <br />A city of art and architecture awaits, <br />But Athena, the wisdom goddess, dominates.</p>
        <p>She&rsquo;s destroying her own creations with glee, <br />And residing within the Temple of the Hill, she will be. <br />Defended by Otus and Tyto, the Owls so grand, <br />But defeat them and Erichthonius will lend a hand.</p>
        <p>The son of Athena, imprisoned so unfair, <br />But from Otus&rsquo;s belly, he will be aware. <br />He&rsquo;ll share the goddess&rsquo;s weaknesses and might, <br />Her disgust of men, her affection for light.</p>
        <p>The Tome of Demise, she guards with all care, <br />A chronicle ancient, with knowledge beyond compare. <br />So, hurry and defeat her, with strategy so true, <br />And find the truth, to what you must do.</p>
        <p>The protection of Gaia, may be in sight, <br />For the Gods are dethroned, with every fight. <br />So, seek and discover, the truth of the land, <br />And bring forth the victory, with thine sword in hand.&rdquo;</p>
