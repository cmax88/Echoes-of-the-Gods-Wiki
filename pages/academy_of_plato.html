        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>You stand before the entrance, the beautiful marble archway inviting you in. Bordering the schoolhouse are thick hedges that paint the landscape with a mesmerizing green hue. The academy stands tall, three stories in height, with elegant windows perfectly placed throughout. At the entryway, its beautiful columns rise up from the ground, supporting a monumental marble roof. On the left stands a finely crafted pavilion of marble and bronze. The large ornate wooden doors stare welcomingly at you, urging you to come inside. The trimmed lawns create a homely feel as you walk towards the doors. The doors swing heavily as you open them, a warm rush of air escaping as the interior comes into view. Along the back of the academy, another pavilion sits in the corner, shrouded by the shadow of an immense colorful bush.</p>

        <p>As you enter the academy, you are greeted by the grand entrance hall. The high ceiling is adorned with intricate paintings and frescoes of the Gods and myths of the land. The floor is made of gleaming marble, and the walls are speckled with tall, elegant columns. To your left, you see a room filled with rows of wooden desks and chairs, where the students of the academy learn and study the ways of the Gods. The room is well-lit by windows that let in the warm, golden light of the sun. On the walls are maps of the ancient world and illustrations of the Gods and their deeds. To your right, there is a large room with a raised platform in the center. This is the lecture hall, where the professors of the academy share their lessons on the Gods and their stories. The room is surrounded by tiers of seating so that all of the students can have a good view of the lecture. Further down the hall, you notice a library. The shelves are filled with books and scrolls, containing the knowledge and history of the Gods and the world. There are also tables and chairs, where students can sit and study. At the end of the hall, you find the headmaster's office. This room is grand and ornate, with rich tapestries on the walls and a large, imposing desk in the center. The headmaster is the most knowledgeable of all the professors and is the one who oversees the education of the students at the academy.</section>
