        <p>As you approach the smith&rsquo;s shop, the sound of clanging metal and the smell of hot coals fill your senses. The building is a large brick structure, with walls made of soot-stained stone blocks. The entrance is guarded by two stone gargoyles, their eyes glowing with a fiery red light. The doors are made of wrought iron and decorated with intricate designs of hammers and anvils, symbolizing the God of Blacksmithing. Above the entrance, there is a sign made of metal that reads "Smith of Hephaestus". The windows on either side of the doors are stained glass, depicting scenes of the God of the Forge at his workshop, his muscles rippling as he creates weapons and tools. The roof is a steep, sloping design, made of metal shingles. The chimneys at the back of the building release smoke into the air, a reminder of the intense heat within.</p>

        <p>As you step inside, you are immediately struck by the heat and intense energy of the forge. Rows of glowing coals line the walls, casting an orange light that dances over the rows of hammers, anvils, and worktables. At the center of the room, a massive forge dominates the space, its flames leaping high as a blacksmith works the bellows with a steady rhythm. Around the forge, you see rows of shelves and cabinets, filled with all manner of tools and materials. Copper, iron, and other metals are stacked in neat piles, while rows of hammers and chisels line the walls. Behind the forge, you see a workshop area, with a large worktable and several benches filled with tools and equipment. A row of windows lines the wall, letting in light and fresh air. Despite the intense heat of the forge, the air inside the shop is clean and clear, thanks to a series of vents and chimneys that funnel smoke and ash up and out of the building. The walls are made of sturdy stone, with large wooden beams overhead to support the roof. The floor is made of wide flagstones, providing a solid and stable surface for the blacksmiths to work on.</section>
