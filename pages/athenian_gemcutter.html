        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This temple sits by the Illithos River at the Western edge of the municipality. It is dedicated to the God Plutus, God of Wealth. It is the smallest temple in Athena but holds great value to the people of Kiffisia.</p>
        <h3>Exterior</h3>

        <p>As you approach the gemcutter's store, you are struck by its simple, yet elegant facade. The store is housed in a small, single-story building, constructed entirely of white marble. The entrance is marked by a set of double doors, carved with ornate designs of gold and silver inlaid into the marble. The roof is peaked and is topped with a large, gold-plated statue of the Goddess of gold, silver, and gems, Theia. The store's sign, hanging above the entrance, reads &ldquo;Theialyus&rdquo; in bold, golden letters. On either side of the entrance, there are large, plate glass windows, showcasing the store's finest pieces of jewelry. The store is surrounded by a well-manicured garden, filled with exotic flowers and shrubs.</p>
        <h3>Interior</h3>

        <br>
        <p>As you step inside the store, you are immediately enveloped by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The room is lit by gentle, golden light that spills from delicate lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The air is filled with the sweet scent of lavender and rosemary, mixed with the crisp aroma of cutting oils. The floor is tiled in white marble, inlaid with precious stones and gems of all shapes, sizes, and colors. In the center of the room stands a massive wooden counter, polished to a high shine. Behind the counter, you see a master gem cutter, his skilled hands deftly working a piece of amethyst. To the left, you see shelves upon shelves of jewelry, ranging from simple gold bands to elaborate necklaces and bracelets set with sparkling gems. To the right, you see a small workshop, where apprentices are learning the art of gem cutting. As you approach the counter, the master gem cutter greets you with a warm smile. He invites you to browse the shelves and admire the expert craftsmanship that has gone into each and every piece of jewelry in the store.</section>
