                <h3>Setting the Stage</h3>
                    <p>"Echoes of the Gods" begins with a primordial silence in the cosmos, broken by the emergence of Kaos, who consumes a star and births Gaia, the Mother Earth. Gaia's dance of creation leads to the birth of Ouranos, and together they spawn the Titans, Cyclops, and Hecatoncheires. When Ouranos imprisons the Hecatoncheires, Gaia's rage incites rebellion, leading to Kronos overthrowing Ouranos.

                        Kronos, ruling with fear of a prophecy that he would be dethroned by his own son, swallows each of his offspring with Rhea, except for Zeus, who is hidden away. Zeus grows strong, forces Kronos to expel his siblings, and leads a rebellion, culminating in a war against the Titans. With the aid of the freed Cyclops and Hecatoncheires, Zeus defeats the Titans, banishes them to Tartarus, and punishes Atlas.
                        
                        Zeus's reign is marked by his offspring with various goddesses and mortals, including Athena, born from his head. He creates human races in different ages: the Golden Age of peace, the Silver Age ending in destruction, the Bronze Age of war, and the Iron Age, where Zeus attempts to control mankind's destiny. However, Prometheus's gift of fire to mankind and Zeus's creation of Pandora, who unleashes evils but also hope upon the world, sets the stage for an era of potential human uprising against the divine—a rebellion of the gods and mortals seeking autonomy and justice.</p>

                    
                    <h3>The Prophecy</h3>
                    <p>Prometheus, the God of Futures, writes an epic foretelling of the adventurers’ tales to come. These tales, known as The Prophecy, offer insight into the Gods and cities of Gaia. Written in passages, The Prophecy guides the players and leads them into epic battles and wars with the Gods and those who wish to rid Gaia of her mortals.</p>
